                <li>Albert Einstein (1879–1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who is widely regarded as one of
                    the most influential scientists of the 20th century. His groundbreaking contributions to physics
                    revolutionized our understanding of the universe and laid the foundation for modern physics. Born in
                    Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire, Einstein showed an early interest in
                    mathematics and science.</li>
                <li>Einstein's most famous work is his theory of relativity, which he developed in the early 20th
                    century. In 1905, he published his paper on the special theory of relativity, introducing the famous
                    equation which expresses the equivalence of mass and energy. This theory fundamentally changed the
                    way scientists understand space, time, and gravity, and it has had profound implications for
                    physics, cosmology, and philosophy.</li>
                <li>In 1915, Einstein completed his general theory of relativity, which provided a new understanding of
                    gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass and energy. This theory
                    predicted phenomena such as gravitational waves, which were finally detected in 2015, confirming
                    Einstein's predictions and earning him posthumous acclaim.</li>
                <li>Einstein also made significant contributions to quantum mechanics, particularly with his work on the
                    photoelectric effect, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. His insights into
                    the nature of light and matter helped lay the groundwork for the development of quantum theory.</li>
